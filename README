This project requires a database to store the invoice data extracted from the uploaded PDFs. The SQLite database is used in this project for simplicity and ease of use. You can set up the database and interact with it using Python and the sqlite3 library, or any SQL client that supports SQLite.

Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

Python (3.6 or higher)
SQLite (SQLite3 library or SQLite database file)
Required Libraries:
sqlite3 (for Python database interaction)
Any other libraries for PDF extraction or other project needs
Database Schema
The database consists of three main tables:

1. invoices
This table stores the general information for each invoice.

    customer_name TEXT,
